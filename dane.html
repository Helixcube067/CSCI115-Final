		<p> This is a regal breed that combines great size and power with elegance (which is different for the famous Scooby-Doo) </p>
		
		<p> Their coat is short, thick, and glossy. Great danes are one of the largest dogs and are very gentle for their size. Children can be afraid of them due to their friendliness and their size though. </p>

<h2> Extra facts about Great Danes </h2>
	<p> The Great dane is gentle, loving, easygoing, and sensitive. Generally good with children (although its size and friendly attitudes may overwhelm a small child) and usually good with other dogs and pets. It is powerful and responsive to training. Makes a well-mannered and pleasant family companion. </p>
	
	<p> Their original function were to serve as guardians or hunting large game but now they serve as companions.</p>
	
	<p> Great dane care consists of daily moderate exercise. Despit how sturdy it looks it is not suited to live exclusively outside. Managing its time inside and out is the best way to keep a Great Dane. It needs soft bedding and room to stretch out when sleeping. Their coat care is minimal. </p>
	
	<p> They are actually not the tallest dog. Some Great Danes also act as therapy dogs. They can be very gentle but also very aggressive at times. This comes from the fact they were once hunting dogs. Great danes also grow very fast. </p>
	
	<p> Surprisingly Great Danes are very emotionally sensitive dogs. They need people and need close contact to their human family. Anxiety can also kill them. </p>
	
	<p> Health concerns include: </p>
		<ul>
			<li> Major concerns: gastric torsion, CHD, cardiomyopathy </li>
			<li> Minor concerns: CVI (wobbler's syndrome), cataract, elbow dysplasia, osteosarcoma, OCD, HOD </li> 
			<li> Occasionally seen: glaucoma, vWD </li>
			<li> Suggested tests: cardiac, elbow, hip, eye, blood </li>
			<li> Life span: 6 â€“ 8 years </li>
