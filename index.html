		<h1> Therapy dog info </h1>
		<p> Therapy dogs are dogs who go with their owners to volunteer in settings such as schools, hospitals, and nursing homes.</p>

		<p> From working with a child who is learning to read to visiting a senior in assisted living, therapy dogs and their owners work together as a team to improve the lives of other people. </p>

		<p> Therapy dogs are not service dogs. Service dogs are dogs who are specially trained to perform specific tasks to help a person who has a disability. An example of a service dog is a dog who guides an owner who is blind, or a dog who assists someone who has a physical disability. Service dogs stay with their person and have special access privileges in public places such as on planes, restaurants, etc. Therapy dogs, the dogs who will be earning the AKC Therapy Dogâ„¢ title, do not have the same special access as service dogs. </p>

		<p> It is unethical to attempt to pass off a therapy dog as a service dog for purposes such as flying on a plane or being admitted to a restaurant. </p>
		
		<p> Some mental benefits include: </p>
			<ul>
				<li> Decrease in stress and anxiety, including that from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)</li>

				 <li> Decrease in depression, loneliness and feelings of isolation and aggressive behaviors </li>

				 <li> Increase in socialization with an outward focus, including opportunities for laughter and a sense of happiness and well-being </li>

				 <li> Increase in mental stimulation, attention skills, and verbal interactions </li>

				 <li> Increase in spirit, self-esteem, and feeling of acceptance, enabling a patient to further participate in mental and physical therapy; to be more involved in group activities; and to accept social and emotional support </li>
			</ul>

		<p> Some physical benefits include: </p>
			<ul>
				 <li> Decrease in blood pressure, heart rate, and the stress hormone cortisol </li>

				 <li> Increase in hormones associated with health and feeling of well-being, including beta-endorphin, beta-phenylethylamine, dopamine, oxytocin, prolactin and serotonin </li>

				 <li> Increase in level of fitness by providing stimulus for exercise, with improvement in activities in which they are limited </li>

				 <li> Improvement in motor skills including standing balance, wheelchair and other physical skills </li>
			</ul>
		<p> Most people think of hospitals and retirement homes they think of therapy animals. In fact, therapy animals serve in a tremendous variety of venues, and the number of ways in which they help people is equally great and varied. </p>

		<p> Working with very ill children, Alzheimer's patients, or in a hospice sounds like a wonderful way to serve. But if dealing with such circumstances is difficult for you, know that there will be others that will do well with them. </p>	

		<p> Find a venue for your therapy animal work that you and your animal will be comfortable with and enjoy, and you'll be able to give the best you have to offer. </p>

		<h1> Service dog info </h1>
			<h2> What are service dogs? </h2>
				<p> Service animals are dogs (and in some cases, miniature horses) trained to perform major life tasks to assist people with physical or severe psychiatric impairments/disabilities. Service animals are sometimes referred to as assistance animals, assist animals, support animals, or helper animals depending on the country and the animal's function. </p>
			<h2> How To Qualify for A Service Dog </h2>
				<p> For a person to legally qualify to have a service dog, he/she must have a physical impairment (or severe psychiatric impairment) that substantially limits his/her ability to perform at least one major life activity without assistance. There are no limitations with respect to the kinds of impairments/disabilties this applies to. </p>
			<h2> What Is a Physical Impairment? </h2>
				<p> A physical impairment is any medical disorder, condition, disfigurement or loss affecting one of the body systems, such as: </p>
					<ul>
						<li> Neurological </li>
						<li> Musculoskeletal </li> 
						<li> Special sense organs </li>
						<li> Respiratory (including speech organs) </li>
						<li> Cardiovascular
						<li> Reproductive 
						<li> Digestive </li> 
						<li> Genitourinary immune </li> 
						<li> Circulatory </li>
						<li> Hemic </li> 
						<li> Lymphatic </li> 
						<li> Skin </li>  
						<li> Endocrine </li>
					</ul>
				<p> Some examples of phsycial impairment include: </p>
					<ul>
						<li> AIDS and its symptoms </li>
						<li> Alcoholism </li>
						<li> Asthma </li>
						<li> Blindness or other visual impairments </li> 
						<li> Cancer </li>
						<li> Cerebral palsy </li>
						<li> Depression </li>
						<li> Diabetes </li>
						<li> Epilepsy </li> 
						<li> Hearing or speech impairments </li> 
						<li> Heart Disease </li> 
						<li> Migraine Headaches </li>
						<li> Multiple sclerosis </li>
						<li> Muscular dystrophy </li> 
						<li> Orthopedic impairments </li> 
						<li>Paralysis </li> 
						<li>Complications from Pregnancy </li>
						<li> Thyroid gland disorders </li> 
						<li> Tuberculosis </li> 
						<li> Loss of body parts </li>
					</ul>
			<h2> Registration </h2>
				<p> Registration is not federally mandated or compulsory, but voluntary. The importance of registering your service dog, however, is that it not only legitimizes your dog (making him/her look official), but eliminates nearly all the hassles and confrontation you'll encounter without it. This is why National Service Animal Registry exists: To make life easier and less problematic for the disabled! Several members of the NSAR staff group are disabled and can attest to how much easier it has been to take their animals in public after they were registered and attired appropriately.</p>
